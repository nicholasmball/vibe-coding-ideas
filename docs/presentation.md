# From Idea to Shipped Product in One Conversation

### How VibeCodes turns anyone into a software builder

---

## The Problem

Building software the traditional way requires a small army.

| Role | What they do |
|---|---|
| Product Owner | Defines requirements, writes user stories |
| Business Analyst | Breaks features into specs |
| UX Designer | Designs interfaces and flows |
| Developer | Writes the code |
| QA Tester | Finds and verifies bugs |
| DevOps | Deploys and maintains infrastructure |
| Project Manager | Coordinates all of the above |

**Cost:** $500K–$1M+/year. **Time to MVP:** 3–6 months. **Handoffs:** Dozens per sprint.

Every handoff loses context. Every meeting burns time. By the time code ships, it barely resembles the original vision.

> **Speaker notes:** Ask the audience: "How many of you have had a product idea but couldn't justify hiring a team to build it?" This is the problem VibeCodes solves.

---

## The Vision

**One person + AI = shipped software.**

No handoffs. No sprints. No waiting for estimates. No "we'll get to it next quarter."

You describe what you want. AI plans it, builds it, and tracks every step — while you make the decisions that matter.

> **Speaker notes:** This isn't hypothetical. VibeCodes was built this way. The platform managed its own development through the same AI workflow it offers to every user.

## Meet VibeCodes

The AI-powered idea board where concepts become shipped code.

- **Idea feed** — Share ideas, get community feedback, upvote the best ones
- **Threaded comments** — Structured discussion with comments, suggestions, and questions
- **Kanban boards** — Full project management with drag-and-drop task boards
- **Real-time updates** — Every change streams live — no refresh needed
- **Direct AI integration** — AI doesn't just advise. It acts.

> **Speaker notes:** VibeCodes isn't a chatbot wrapper. It's a full project management platform with AI as a first-class team member. Everything you see in the next slides is real — not a mockup, not a concept.

---

## How It Works — Step 1: Drop an Idea

You describe a rough concept. Three sentences is enough.

*"I want a personal finance tracker that categorises expenses and shows spending trends. Users should be able to set monthly budgets and get alerts."*

Post it. The community can vote and comment — or skip straight to AI.

> **Speaker notes:** The idea doesn't need to be polished. That's the whole point. You bring the vision; AI does the refinement.

---

## How It Works — Step 2: AI Refines the Concept

One command: *"Improve this idea description."*

AI reads your 3-sentence concept and expands it into a detailed product spec — user stories, feature breakdown, technical scope.

Your rough sketch becomes a document you could hand to any development team. You didn't write a word of it.

> **Speaker notes:** This is the Product Owner role, automated. What normally takes a week of stakeholder interviews and requirement gathering happens in seconds.

---

## How It Works — Step 3: AI Creates the Board

One command: *"Create a full task board for this idea."*

AI generates:
- **Columns** — To Do, In Progress, Done (or custom)
- **Tasks** — 10–20 well-scoped work items
- **Labels** — Colour-coded by priority and category
- **Checklists** — Subtasks within each task
- **Due dates** — Timeline for delivery

Open the board in your browser. It's all there.

> **Speaker notes:** This is the BA and PM roles, automated. A full project plan from a 3-sentence idea. No planning poker. No estimation meetings. No Jira ticket factory.

---

## How It Works — Step 4: AI Works the Tasks

AI picks up tasks one by one. It assigns itself, moves cards to "In Progress", writes code, ticks off checklist items, and moves completed tasks to "Done."

**You watch it happen in real time on the board.**

Cards move. Checklists fill up. Comments appear. The activity log captures everything.

> **Speaker notes:** This is the Developer role, automated. And it's not working in isolation — every action is visible on the shared board, just like a human team member would be.

---

## How It Works — Step 5: You Make the Decisions

AI handles execution but defers to you on what matters.

*"Should we use a pie chart or bar chart?"*
*"Monthly or weekly as the default view?"*
*"Do you want email notifications or just in-app?"*

You decide. AI continues. You stay CEO — not a coder.

> **Speaker notes:** This is the critical difference. AI doesn't make product decisions. It accelerates everything around those decisions. You keep the steering wheel; AI is the engine.

---

## How It Works — Step 6: Bug? Filed and Fixed.

*"The dashboard shows NaN when there are no transactions."*

AI creates a bug report with a red label, diagnoses the issue, implements the fix, and marks it done. Full audit trail on every step.

One sentence. Minutes later, it's fixed.

> **Speaker notes:** This is QA + Developer + Support, automated. The traditional bug cycle — report, triage, assign, investigate, fix, verify, close — collapses into a single conversation turn.

---

## The MCP Engine

**Model Context Protocol** is what makes this possible.

MCP is an open standard that gives AI tools direct access to your applications. Instead of suggesting what to do, AI can actually do it.

VibeCodes exposes **38 tools** to AI:

| Category | Tools |
|---|---|
| Ideas | Create, update, refine, manage tags and status |
| Board | Create columns and tasks, move cards, set due dates |
| Labels & Checklists | Categorise work, track subtasks |
| Comments | Discuss on ideas and tasks, @mention team members |
| Bugs | File reports, track fixes |
| Collaboration | Add team members, assign work |
| Notifications | Stay informed on all changes |

> **Speaker notes:** MCP is the secret sauce. It's what separates "AI that gives advice" from "AI that does the work." And because it's an open standard, any AI tool can plug in — not just Claude.

## What AI Replaces

| Traditional Role | What AI Does Instead |
|---|---|
| **Product Owner** | Refines requirements, creates task boards from rough ideas |
| **Business Analyst** | Breaks features into tasks with acceptance criteria |
| **Developer** | Writes code, implements features, fixes bugs |
| **QA Tester** | Files bug reports, verifies fixes, tracks issues |
| **DevOps** | Handles deployment pipelines |
| **Project Manager** | Manages board, assigns tasks, tracks progress |
| **Support** | Triages and categorises incoming issues |

AI doesn't replace judgment. It replaces overhead.

> **Speaker notes:** The CEO still makes every important decision. AI just removes the army of people needed to execute those decisions. One person's vision, directly to shipped code.

---

## Real-time Everything

Every change streams live. No refresh. No sync issues.

- AI moves a task → you see it instantly on the board
- AI adds a comment → it appears in the thread immediately
- Multiple people and AI bots can work on the same board simultaneously
- Full activity timeline on every task — who did what, when

Built on Supabase Realtime for instant, reliable updates.

> **Speaker notes:** This is what makes VibeCodes feel magical. You can literally watch AI work. Cards move across the board, checklists fill up, comments appear — all in real time. It's like having a glass-walled office where you can see your entire team working.

---

## Collaboration: Humans + AI Together

VibeCodes isn't just for solo builders.

- **Multiple human collaborators** on the same idea
- **Multiple AI bot personas** — Developer, Designer, QA, each with custom expertise
- **Assign tasks** to humans or AI — same board, same workflow
- **@mention** team members in task comments
- **Activity timeline** tracks everything everyone does

The future isn't humans OR AI. It's humans AND AI, working side by side.

> **Speaker notes:** You can create specialised AI bots — a QA tester that focuses on bugs, a UX designer that reviews interfaces, a backend engineer that handles API work. Each has its own persona and expertise, all working on your board.

## The Numbers

| | Traditional Team | VibeCodes + AI |
|---|---|---|
| **Team size** | 6–8 people | 1 person + AI |
| **Time to MVP** | 3–6 months | Days to weeks |
| **Annual cost** | $500K–$1M+ | ~$200/month |
| **Handoffs** | Dozens per sprint | Zero |
| **Context loss** | Constant | None — AI remembers everything |
| **Reprioritization** | Sprint renegotiation | One sentence |
| **Bug turnaround** | Days to weeks | Minutes to hours |

> **Speaker notes:** These numbers aren't theoretical. VibeCodes was built in weeks, not months, using its own platform. The $200/month is AI API costs — that's it. No salaries, no benefits, no office space, no standups.
