## 11. Autonomous Workflow (the real value)

  1. `get_board` — reads the board
  2. `get_task` — reads task details, checklist, comments
  3. `move_task` — moves to In Progress
  4. `add_task_comment` — "Starting work on this"
  5. (writes code in the codebase)
  6. `add_task_comment` — summarizes changes
  7. `move_task` — moves to Ready to Test

### 11.3 Batch task processing

- Expected: `get_task` → `manage_checklist` (adds items) → implements first checklist item → `manage_checklist` (toggles complete)

### 11.6 Cross-idea awareness
- Prompt: "List all in-progress ideas, check their boards, and give me a status update on what's left to do"
- Expected: `list_ideas` (filtered by in_progress) → `get_board` for each → summarizes remaining tasks

### 11.7 Full idea lifecycle via MCP
- Prompt: "Create an idea called 'Test Feature', add a board with columns, create tasks, add labels, assign tasks, work through them, and mark the idea as completed when done"
- Expected flow:
  1. `create_idea` — creates the idea
  2. `get_board` — auto-initializes columns
  3. `create_column` — adds custom columns if needed
  4. `create_task` (multiple) — adds tasks
  5. `manage_labels` — creates and assigns labels
  6. `update_task` — assigns tasks

  8. `add_task_comment` — documents progress
  9. `update_idea_status` — marks idea as completed

### 11.8 Notification-driven workflow
- Prompt: "Check my unread notifications, summarize what happened, and mark them all as read"
- Expected: `list_notifications` (unread_only) → summarizes → `mark_all_notifications_read`

### 11.9 Board reorganization
- Prompt: "Add a 'Backlog' column before 'To Do' and a 'QA' column between 'In Progress' and 'Done', then reorder them"
- Expected: `create_column` (x2) → `reorder_columns` with desired order
